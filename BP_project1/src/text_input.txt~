Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. *Mac OSX* distributions from 10.3 (Panther) and up, include a version of Python, which, *although it can be as much as two years* out of date, may be suitable for beginning. Linux distributions also frequently include Python and it is readily upgraded.

There are currently two major versions of Python available: Python 2 and *Python 3*. The Python2orPython3 page provides advice on how to decide which one will best suit your needs. At the time of writing (21 Jun 2010), the rest of this page assumes you've decided to use Python 2.

See BeginnersGuide/Download for instructions for downloading the correct version of Python.

*At some stage*, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.
